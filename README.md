# PathfindingApp (US-Version) Demonstration

Note: This project was difficult to put together, it was done before the GPT era. It was challenging, but rewarding.

Picture quality looks better not recorded (max 1080p recorded). Speed adjustments vary by performance of your computer.

Additionally, there were some complex issues that I came across, had to think outside the box to overcome them. Especiallly, since I had no projects to reference from.

I took various library functions and created something complex, completely off my own imagination. Roughly, 1000 lines of code.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pathfinding App documentation. The Pathfinding App is an interactive tool that enables users to visualize and understand various pathfinding algorithms in a user-friendly interface. It features adjustable speed settings, resizable nodes and edges, and a pause/resume animation feature to control visualization. 

## Features

### Speed Adjustment

The Speed Adjustment feature provides an intuitive slider control, allowing users to control the speed of the algorithm execution in real-time. This is helpful for both learning purposes, by slowing down to understand each step, and for time efficiency, by speeding up the algorithm once the concept is understood.

### Resizing Feature

The Resizing feature allows users to manipulate the size of nodes and edges in the graph.This allows users with the ability to adjust the size of nodes and edges in the graph. You can modify the size of these elements, making the graph larger, smaller, or adjust it to your preferred size to fit your screen. This functionality allows for a more personalized viewing experience.

### Pause/Resume Animation

Our Pause/Resume Animation feature enables users to control the visualization flow of the algorithm. This function allows users to pause the algorithm at any time to study the current state, and then resume when ready. 

## Algorithms

The Pathfinding App supports a wide array of pathfinding algorithms, including but not limited to:

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Best First Search
4. A* Search Algorithm
5. Beam Search
6. Dijkstra's Algorithm

Each algorithm comes with a brief description, use case scenarios, and pros and cons to provide a better understanding of its working principles and applications.
