## Introduction

Welcome to the Pathfinding App documentation. The Pathfinding App is an interactive tool that enables users to visualize and understand various pathfinding algorithms in a user-friendly interface. It features adjustable speed settings, resizable nodes and edges, and a pause/resume animation feature to control visualization. 

## Features

### Speed Adjustment

The Speed Adjustment feature provides an intuitive slider control, allowing users to control the speed of the algorithm execution in real-time. This is helpful for both learning purposes, by slowing down to understand each step, and for time efficiency, by speeding up the algorithm once the concept is understood.

### Resizing of Edges and Nodes

Understanding the scalability of algorithms is crucial. Therefore, the Resizing feature allows users to manipulate the size of nodes and edges in the graph. By using simple drag and drop mechanics, you can resize nodes and edges to model different situations and observe how algorithms react to different conditions.

### Pause/Resume Animation

Our Pause/Resume Animation feature enables users to control the visualization flow of the algorithm. This function allows users to pause the algorithm at any time to study the current state, and then resume when ready. 

## Algorithms

The Pathfinding App supports a wide array of pathfinding algorithms, including but not limited to:

1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Search Algorithm
3. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
4. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
5. Depth-First Search (DFS)

Each algorithm comes with a brief description, use case scenarios, and pros and cons to provide a better understanding of its working principles and applications.
